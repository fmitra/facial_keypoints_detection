# Kaggle Facial Keypoints Detection

Predicting the location of facial keypoints for Kaggle. This submission is in 2 parts. 

The first submission `custom_net.py` is an attempt to create a neural network using numpy. The implementation may not be ideal and was written to tie together concepts I learned in Coursera's Machine Learning course. 

The second submission, `facial_keypoints_detection.py` implements scikit-learn's `MLPRegressor` and was written to help benchmark my custom net. 

Kaggle Score (`facial_keypoints_detection`): 12.10503
